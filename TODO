File System Templates
- make template folder configurable
- fix file/folder permission issues
- detect xattr and limit functionality accordingly (maybe)
- add pre-export addon code to make sure no templates are missed
- add support for other styles

Addons
- add a working addon dropbox to top of site
- add various quick add links to the top to add things like phrases, routes, listeners etc
- add extra addon dev options. Things like paths (so we can do build functionality creating hashes for files etc)
- add the ability to call a script pre and post build
- add ability to only show certain addons when viewing lists

Phrases
- add postsave template checks for new phrases
- add a file scanning system (needs the paths from above to be efficient)
